I’m a Ph.D. Candidate of Com­puter Sci­ence study­ing at State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhe­jiang Uni­ver­sity (as of November 2022) and a [ZJUIDG](http://zjuidg.org/ "ZJUIDG") group mem­ber su­per­vised by Prof. [Yingcai Wu](http://ycwu.org/ "ycwu"). My cur­rent re­search in­ter­est are in Visual Analytics, Spatiotemporal Visualization, and Urban Computing.
