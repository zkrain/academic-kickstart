# Abstract.
abstract = "Spatial time series visualization offers scientific research pathways and analytical decision-making tools across various spatiotemporal domains. Despite many advanced methodologies, the seamless integration of temporal and spatial information remains a challenge. The space-time cube (STC) stands out as a promising approach for the synergistic presentation of spatial and temporal information, with successful applications across various spatiotemporal datasets. However, the STC is plagued by well-known issues such as visual occlusion and depth ambiguity, which are further exacerbated when dealing with large-scale spatial time series data. In this study, we introduce a novel technical framework termed VolumeSTCube, designed for continuous spatiotemporal phenomena. It first leverages the concept of the STC to transform discretely distributed spatial time series data into continuously volumetric data. Subsequently, volume rendering and surface rendering techniques are employed to visualize the transformed volumetric data. Volume rendering is utilized to mitigate visual occlusion, while surface rendering provides pattern details by enhanced lighting information. Lastly, we design interactions to facilitate the exploration and analysis from temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal perspectives. VolumeSTCube is evaluated through a computational experiment, a real-world case study with one expert, and a controlled user study with twelve non-experts, compared against a baseline from prior work, showing its superiority and effectiveness in largescale spatial time series analysis."
